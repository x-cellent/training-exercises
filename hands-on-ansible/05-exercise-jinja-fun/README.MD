# Jinja Fun

1. Sort and print the given `versions` list. Use a filter for that.
2. Iterate over the sorted list and print the version if it is `>= 4.3.3`. Search for the `version` filter to complete the task.
3. Iterate over the `fruits` dict. If a fruit is yellow print its name.
4. Take the `test.json` and use a filter to format it to `yaml`. Then reformat the `yaml` to `json` again.
