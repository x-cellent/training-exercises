Exercise: docker compose
========================

1. Start the docker-compose.yaml
2. Try the app at https://workspace0.training.xc-cloud.net/monster
3. Check the error in the container
4. Extend docker-compose.yaml
   
      The docker-compose.yaml already includes the identicon app.  
      Install `redis` and `amouat/dnmonster` and open the correct ports to fix the problem.

5. Look at your new monster!
